function Lap = compute_laplacian(x,y,z,N)
% COMPUTE_LAPLACIAN   Generate Laplacian with respect to a set of points
% LAP = COMPUTE_LAPLACIAN(X,Y,Z,N) takes in the coordinates of a set of
% points that are randomly scattered on an unknown surface and generates
% a discrete approximation of the Laplacian using the nearest N points.
% X, Y, and Z are column vectors of the same length, and N must be a
% positive integer.
%
% Example
%   x = repmat([0:5],6,1); x = x(:);
%   y = repmat([0:5]',1,6); y = y(:);
%   z = repmat([0:0.1:0.5],6,1); z = z(:);
%   N = 4;
